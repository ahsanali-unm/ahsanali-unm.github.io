I am Ahsan Ali, a passionate researcher and educator in applied mathematics, specializing in scalable numerical solvers and multilevel methods for non-symmetric and indefinite problems. My research focuses on developing and analyzing algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods to improve the efficiency and robustness of numerical algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). These methods find applications across diverse fields, including computational physics, engineering, and traffic flow modeling.

I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics (2011) and an M.S. in Mathematics (2012) from Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Later, I earned a second M.S. in Applied Mathematics (2024) from the University of New Mexico (UNM), where I am currently completing my Ph.D. My dissertation explores "Algebraic Multigrid Methods for Non-symmetric and Indefinite Problems." Alongside my academic work, I contribute to interdisciplinary collaborations with national laboratories and academic institutions, emphasizing innovative approaches to scientific computing and numerical modeling.

With over seven years of formal teaching experience and a decade of involvement in mathematics education, I have designed and taught a variety of courses, ranging from undergraduate calculus to graduate-level numerical analysis. My teaching philosophy is rooted in equity, inclusion, and fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts among students from diverse backgrounds.

When I am not solving equations or mentoring students, I enjoy traveling, spending time with my daughter, and watching videos about the latest tech gadgets.
