excerpt: 'This paper presents a modified macroscopic traffic flow model incorporating a constant inflow term in a first-order traffic equation with a linear velocity-density relationship. Treated as an Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP), the model employs a first-order explicit upwind finite difference scheme, with rigorous well-posedness results and numerical simulations highlighting the effects of constant inflow.'
