title: "Numerical solution of a fluid dynamic traffic flowmodel associated with a constant rate inflow"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2015-05-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper presents a modified macroscopic traffic flow model incorporating a constant inflow term in a first-order traffic equation with a linear velocity-density relationship. Treated as an Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP), the model employs a first-order explicit upwind finite difference scheme, with rigorous well-posedness results and numerical simulations highlighting the effects of constant inflow.'
